I developed Gemini-Clone, a web-based AI chatbot that interacts with users using the Gemini API. The project is built using React.js for the frontend, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and responsive user interface. The chatbot dynamically fetches responses from the Gemini model and displays them in real time, replicating the experience of using a modern AI assistant.# Gemini-Clon
